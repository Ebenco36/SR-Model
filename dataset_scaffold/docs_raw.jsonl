Study risk of bias was assessed using the Effective Public Health Practice Project tool. We pooled data using random-effects meta-analysis and conducted moderation analyses to examine variance in uptake by sex of child and parent.\n\nResults Seventy-nine studies on 840 838 parents across 15 countries were included. The pooled proportion of parents’ uptake of HPV vaccines for their children was 41.5% (range: 0.7%–92.8%), twofold higher for girls (46.5%) than for boys (20.3%). In the meta-analysis of 62 studies, physician recommendation (r=0.46 (95% CI 0.34 to 0.56)) had the greatest influence on parents’ uptake, followed by HPV vaccine safety concerns (r=−0.31 (95% CI −0.41 to −0.16)), routine child preventive check-up, past 12 months (r=0.22 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.33)) and parents’ belief in vaccines (r=0.19 (95% CI 0.08 to 0.29)). Health insurance-covered HPV vaccination (r=0.16 (95% CI 0.04 to 0.29)) and lower out-of-pocket cost (r=−0.15 (95% CI −0.22 to −0.07)) had significant effects on uptake. We found significant moderator effects for sex of child.\n\nConclusions Findings indicate suboptimal levels of HPV vaccine uptake, twofold lower among boys, that may be improved by increasing physician recommendations, addressing parental safety concerns and promoting parents’ positive beliefs about vaccines, in addition to expanding insurance coverage and reducing out-of-pocket costs. Limitations of this meta-analysis include the lack of intervention studies and high risk of bias in most studies reviewed. Further studies should disaggregate HPV vaccine uptake by sex of child and parent.\n\nThis is an Open Access article distributed in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial (CC BY-NC 4.0) license, which permits others to distribute, remix, adapt, build upon this work non-commercially, and license their derivative works on different terms, provided the original work is properly cited and the use is non-commercial.

HPV infection accounts for the majority of cervical and vaginal cancers among women, and of oropharyngeal and anal cancers among men and women.1 HPV infection also accounts for nearly half of vulvar cancer among women and penile cancer among men.1 The bivalent (2vHPV) and quadrivalent HPV vaccine (4vHPV) were licensed in the USA in 2006 for girls and 4vHPV was licensed in 2009 for boys. The nine-valent HPV vaccine (9vHPV) was licensed for girls and boys in 2014. 4vHPV or 9vHPV is recommended for girls and boys age 11 years or older, and women and men through age 26 who have not previously been vaccinated, to prevent HPV infection.2\n\nIncreasing evidence supports the safety and effectiveness of HPV vaccination in reducing vaccine-type HPV infections at the population level. A meta-analysis across nine high-income countries that recommend HPV vaccination of girls indicated that in those countries with female HPV vaccination coverage of 50% or greater, vaccine-type infections decreased by 68%, with evidence suggesting cross-protection and herd effects.3 However, in countries with female HPV vaccine coverage lower than 50%, vaccine-type infections decreased by 50%, with no evidence of cross-protection or herd effects.3 According to the WHO, the HPV vaccine was on the national schedule or reimbursed in 74 countries by 2016,4 5 although coverage among girls and young women varied greatly by region—from 1.1%–1.2% in Africa and Asia, to 31.1% in Europe, to 35.6% in North America for series completion.6 While it is estimated that 9vHPV,7 along with newer HPV vaccination schedules requiring two doses,8 9 will improve health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination for both men and women, accelerating uptake remains crucial to realising the public health benefits of HPV vaccination.\n\nAs the prevalence of HPV infection is highest among young people, HPV vaccination is recommended for preadolescent boys and girls, ideally prior to sexual debut.10 Accordingly, parents play a pivotal role in uptake of HPV vaccines.11 The target age group presents particular challenges for HPV vaccine uptake, including more scrutiny of HPV vaccines than traditional infant vaccines.8 Thus in addition to structural and health system issues (eg, cost, insurance coverage, delivery strategies) that contribute to low coverage of HPV vaccines globally,5 the broader context of vaccine hesitancy suggests that parents’ knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about HPV and vaccines may have a substantial influence on uptake.8 Nevertheless, limited evidence documents factors associated with parents’ uptake of HPV vaccines for their children, particularly outside North America.\n\nEarlier research both predating and following initial introduction of HPV vaccines identified factors associated with parents’ HPV vaccine acceptability and intentions to have their children vaccinated.12 13 The decade elapsed since the first HPV vaccine was licensed, and the documented real-world challenges in the introduction and uptake of HPV vaccines globally indicate the importance of synthesising evidence on factors associated with HPV vaccine uptake.5 We build on previous descriptive reviews of HPV vaccine uptake by conducting a meta-analysis to estimate parents’ uptake of HPV vaccines for their children and factors that influence parents’ uptake. In light of emerging public health recommendations for routine HPV vaccination of boys as well as girls,2 and the substantially lower coverage in boys,14 we included boys in all analyses and assessed sex differences in uptake by child and parent.\n\nObjectives\nThe purpose of this meta-analysis was to synthesise results from quantitative correlational investigations of parents’ uptake of HPV vaccines for their children. Specifically, we aimed to (1) quantify the levels of parents’ HPV vaccine uptake for their children; (2) examine factors correlated with parents’ uptake of HPV vaccines for their children; and (3) identify possible moderating influences of sex of child and parent on uptake.\n\nMethods\nWe conducted a systematic search of the scientific literature and performed random-effects meta-analysis to examine factors associated with parents’ uptake of HPV vaccines for their children. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)15 and Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines.16\n\nSelection criteria\nWe specified eligibility criteria for the search and meta-analyses using the population, intervention (or exposure), comparison, outcome and study design (PICOS) framework. We defined the following key question to be explored: What are the factors associated with parents’ uptake of ≥1 dose of HPV vaccines for their children? We specified the population of interest as parents or guardians of children aged ≤18 years. The intervention or exposure was ≥1 dose of HPV vaccine uptake for children, with the comparator as no doses of HPV vaccine uptake.\n\nThe primary outcome of analysis was parents’ uptake of ≥1 dose of HPV vaccine for their children. The secondary outcomes were factors associated with parents’ HPV vaccine uptake for their children, including parents’ sociodemographic characteristics, HPV risk history (eg, genital warts), HPV vaccine and HPV-related disease knowledge and awareness (eg, HPV vaccine awareness), vaccine attitudes and beliefs (eg, safety concerns, perceived benefits), child preventive healthcare utilisation (eg, routine check-up), healthcare provider factors (eg, healthcare provider recommendation), and structural factors (eg, health insurance coverage of HPV vaccination).\n\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster RCTs, non-RCTs, longitudinal studies, cohort studies and cross-sectional studies that explored parents’ uptake of HPV vaccines for their children. There were no language, geographical or time restrictions. Studies were excluded that did not report original data (eg, reviews, editorials) or examine parents’ uptake of HPV vaccines for their children (eg, acceptability or intention to vaccinate).\n\nSearch strategy\nWe conducted a comprehensive search across multiple electronic databases from inception to locate studies meeting the inclusion criteria: Cochrane Library, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, AIDSLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Social Sciences Abstracts, Ovid MEDLINE, Scholars Portal, Social Sciences Citation Index, Dissertation Abstracts International, Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts, CSA Sociological Abstracts, ProQuest Research Library, CSA Social Services Abstracts, and AgeLine. The last search date was November 2017. Search terms were developed in consultation with a research librarian and chosen to draw on the broadest pool of potential studies. A sample of the search string and keywords used is listed in online supplementary file 1. We also searched for additional relevant studies by reviewing references from the included articles (ie, ‘snowballing’).\n\nSupplementary file 1\n[bmjopen-2017-019206-SP1.pdf]\nData extraction\nTwo authors (ND and AL-D, or AL-D and PB) independently screened all titles and abstracts for inclusion. When the first reviewer determined the study might meet the inclusion criteria based on the study objectives, the full text was obtained. Two reviewers (ND and AL-D, or AL-D and PB) then independently assessed each study for inclusion based on study type and outcome measures, documenting reasons for exclusion. A consensus approach with input from the senior investigator (PAN) was used to resolve disagreements.\n\nWe developed a data extraction form using Microsoft Excel. Two of the five reviewers (ND, AL-D, PB, ST and FA) independently extracted the following data: study information (ie, year of publication, author and journal); descriptive data (ie, sample size, country and participant demographics); study aims, design and methods; outcomes/key findings; and study funding sources and reported conflicts of interest (COIs). Reviewers explored data regarding any variables examined as possible correlates of parents’ HPV vaccine uptake for their children. All members of the research team then developed a list of themes related to HPV vaccine uptake based on a review of the included studies.\n\nRisk of bias\nReviewers independently assessed the risk of bias in individual studies using the Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) ‘Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies’.17 The EPHPP tool has been applied in numerous systematic reviews and has demonstrated inter-rater reliability for both individual domains and overall score.17 We modified the EPHPP for use with cross-sectional studies and examined selection bias (representativeness of sample, participation rate), data collection method (validity, reliability) and study design.18 Reviewers followed the EPHPP rubric to assess whether each component had low, moderate or high risk of bias, with any disagreements resolved by consensus with the senior investigator (PAN).17 For the purpose of moderation analysis, studies with low and moderate risk of bias were grouped together and compared with studies with high risk of bias. No studies were excluded on the basis of risk of bias.\n\nWe assessed each study as to whether commercial entities were declared as providing support for the work reported in the study. Additionally, we indicated potential COIs on the part of study authors, including associations with commercial entities that could be viewed as having an interest in the general area of vaccines (in the 3 years before manuscript submission), per International Committee of Medical Journal Editors guidelines.19\n\nData synthesis and analysis\nWe calculated the pooled proportion of HPV vaccine uptake using the proportion of HPV vaccine uptake reported in each included study. We then conducted meta-analysis to critically evaluate and quantitatively synthesise evidence across studies that examined similar correlates of parents’ HPV vaccine uptake for their children. Combining the results of multiple studies increases statistical power to improve estimates of effects in a larger population. We used the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Software V.2 (Englewood, New Jersey, 2004) to calculate effect sizes for each variable, with a random-effects model to compensate for clinical and methodological diversity among studies. Random-effects models are more conservative than fixed-effect models. Rather than presuming one true effect size, in random-effects models it is assumed that the heterogeneity of studies will contribute to differences in effects between studies, and that there is a distribution of true effect sizes across similar but not identical studies.20 Random-effects models account for the fact that the studies included were conducted by different investigators in different locations at different times, rather than by the same investigator with the same population at a given time point. To derive a global estimate of the correlation of each variable with HPV vaccine uptake, we combined coefficients across studies, and present a summary effect that estimates that distribution’s mean. We calculated the Q statistic to assess homogeneity of correlations across studies and the I2 index to assess the degree of heterogeneity between studies using Higgins and Thompson’s guidelines,21 which indicate that I2 values of 25% represent low, 50% medium and 75% high heterogeneity.\n\nGiven disparities in HPV vaccine uptake for boys and girls, we assessed both sex of child and sex of parent as moderator variables in meta-analysis. Moderation analysis allows for evaluating the impact of a covariate on the outcome variable while holding other covariates constant, and helps to explain heterogeneity in effect sizes in meta-analysis.20 The Comprehensive Meta-Analysis V.2 software enables testing of categorical variables as moderators in order to compare effect sizes between two groups.\n\nAll studies that provided sufficient data regarding correlates of parents’ HPV vaccine uptake for their children were included in the meta-analysis. For studies that did not report sufficient information to enable inclusion in meta-analysis, we contacted study investigators to provide missing and unreported data. We did not conduct meta-analysis on dichotomous (intervention vs control group) data as the vast majority of studies did not evaluate interventions to increase HPV vaccine uptake. However, if an intervention was implemented as part of the study design and baseline/preintervention uptake data were provided, this uptake percentage was used in calculating the pooled proportion of parents’ HPV vaccine uptake for their children.\n\nPatient and public involvement\nNo patients were involved in the development of the research question, development of outcome measures, design or conduct of this study. No patients were asked to advise on interpretation or writing up of results. There are no plans to involve patients in the dissemination of the results of this study.\n\nResults\nStudy selection\nThe literature search yielded 1345 studies with 100% agreement among reviewers (ND, AL-D and PB) in selecting 271 relevant studies, 79 of which met the inclusion criteria. Of the relevant studies, 192 full-text articles were excluded based on the following reasons: 96 assessed intention to vaccinate rather than uptake, 69 did not focus on parents’ HPV vaccine uptake for children, 12 were not quantitative studies, 6 were reviews, 5 contained insufficient data and 4 studies were duplicates (figure 1).\n\nFigure 1\nDownload figure\nOpen in new tab\nDownload powerpoint\nFigure 1\nPRISMA flow chart of the searched, identified and included studies of parents’ uptake of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination for their children.

Table 1 lists the study characteristics and mean uptake of HPV vaccines. Most studies were cross-sectional in design, with seven longitudinal studies,26 33 40 48 52 72 98 one retrospective cohort study,29 one case–control study,32 one quasi-experimental (single-group, pre-post design) study,39 one clustered, non-randomised controlled pragmatic trial62 and one cluster randomised trial.45 Sample sizes ranged from 4345 to 254 48999 (median (M)=617.0), with 88.6% (n=70) ranging from 4345 to 865250 (M=519.5) and 11.4% (n=9) ranging from 15 04934 to 254 48999 (M=65 926).\n\nView inline View popup\nTable 1\nStudies assessing parents’ uptake of HPV vaccines for their children, study characteristics, risk of bias and sponsorship, ordered by mean vaccine uptake (n=79)\n\nThe pooled proportion of parents’ uptake of HPV vaccines for their children ranged from 0.7%100 to 92.8%22 across studies, with overall mean uptake of 41.5% (SD=24.2). The pooled proportion of uptake of HPV vaccines for girls (46.5%) was significantly greater than uptake for girls and boys combined (39.8%) and uptake for boys (20.3%; F(2, 76)=4.92, P=0.010). The average uptake of HPV vaccines among six low-income and middle-income countries25 32 42 44 66 100 was 51.6% compared with 40.6% in 73 high-income countries22–24 26–31 33–41 43 45–65 67–99; however, this difference failed to achieve statistical significance (F(1, 77)=1.13, P=0.292). Comparison of uptake of HPV vaccines between studies with sample sizes ranging from 43 to 9554 (x̅=39.8%) and those ranging from 15 049 to 254 489 (x̅=54.2%) revealed a non-significant trend of studies with sample sizes of ≥15 000 reporting higher uptake than studies with sample sizes <15 000 (F(1, 77)=2.89, P=0.095).\n\nStudy quality\nWe assessed risk of bias for all studies: the majority (75.9%; n=60) had a high risk of bias,22 24 25 27 28 30 31 33–35 37–44 46–54 56 57 59–61 63–67 69–76 78 79 82–84 87–90 92 94 95 97 99 100 19.0% (n=15) low/moderate risk of bias23 29 32 36 55 58 68 77 80 81 85 86 91 93 98 and 5.1% (n=4) low risk of bias.26 45 62 96 No significant difference in parents’ uptake of HPV vaccines for their children was identified between studies with low/moderate risk of bias (x̅=41.3%) and studies with high risk of bias (x̅=41.5%; F(1, 77)=0.002, P=0.967).\n\nFunding and COI\nOverall, 11 studies (13.9%) declared funding from commercial entities (all pharmaceutical companies),23 34 42 53 66 69 74 77 80 84 98 56 (70.9%) declared funding not including commercial entities,22 24–28 30–32 35 36 38–41 44–46 48–52 55–57 59 60 62–65 67 68 70–73 75 76 78 79 81–83 85–90 93 94 96 97 99 and 12 (15.2%) did not specify funding.29 33 37 43 47 54 58 61 91 92 95 100 Twenty-five studies (31.6%)22 24 26 31 32 34 36 41 44 46 49 51 53 57 68 74 76 78 81 84 88 93 94 97 98 declared or were assessed (ie, if author/coauthor declared a COI in another study included in the review within the stipulated time frame) as having a potential COI, 38 (48.1%) declared no COI,23 25 27 28 30 33 35 38–40 42 43 45 47 48 50 52 55 56 59–62 64–66 69 72 75 79 82 83 85–87 89 90 96 and 16 (20.3%) did not specify COI.29 37 54 58 63 67 70 71 73 77 80 91 92 95 99 100 We found no significant difference in uptake of HPV vaccines between studies that declared any funding from commercial entities (x̅=38.5%) versus studies that did not declare any commercial funding (x̅=42.2%; F(1, 77)=0.19, P=0.668). Similarly, there was no statistically significant difference in HPV vaccine uptake between studies with a potential COI (x̅=44.6%) versus those with no COI (x̅=44.5%; F(1, 77)=0.62, P=0.435).\n\nCorrelates of parents’ uptake of HPV vaccines for children\nSixty-two original studies22 24–26 28–36 38–41 43 45 46 48–54 56–59 62 64–67 69–74 76–88 90 92–94 96 98 99 (n=654 100) measured similar correlates of parents’ uptake of HPV vaccines for their children and were included in the meta-analysis (as indicated in table 1). An examination of the pooled proportion of HPV vaccine uptake found no statistically significant difference between studies included in the meta-analysis (n=62; x̅=42.0% uptake) and those not included due to insufficient data (n=17; x̅=39.6% uptake). Based on the available data, we examined correlations between HPV vaccine uptake and 19 factors, organised thematically in eight domains. Table 2 indicates the weighted mean correlational effect sizes (r) measuring associations with HPV vaccine uptake, 95% CI, the Q test of homogeneity and I2 index of between-study variability.\n\nView inline View popup\nTable 2\nMeta-analysis of correlates of parents’ HPV vaccine uptake for their children (n=62 studies; sample size=654 100)\n\nFactors positively associated with parents’ uptake of HPV vaccines for their children were identified in the following domains: (1) healthcare provider—physician recommendation (r=0.46 (95% CI 0.34 to 0.56)) and parents’ trust in healthcare providers (r=0.11 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.21)); (2) parental HPV vaccine decision-maker—mother as HPV vaccine decision-maker (vs both parents) (r=0.34 (95% CI 0.23 to 0.44)); (3) parent’s vaccine beliefs, attitudes and intentions—intention to vaccinate child for HPV (r=0.31 (95% CI 0.17 to 0.43)), belief in vaccines in general (r=0.19 (95% CI 0.08 to 0.29)), perceived HPV vaccine benefits (r=0.17 (95% CI 0.10 to 0.24)) and anticipatory regret if child is not vaccinated (r=0.14 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.17)); (4) preventive healthcare utilisation for child—routine child preventive check-up, past 12 months (r=0.22 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.33)); (5) insurance/cost—health insurance coverage of HPV vaccination (r=0.16 (95% CI 0.04 to 0.29)); (6) parents’ HPV risk history—parent history of HPV (r=0.16 (95% CI 0.06 to 0.25)), mother’s history of having a Pap test (r=0.06 (95% CI 0.004 to 0.107)), parent history of genital warts (r=0.05 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.07)), parent or family member history of abnormal Pap smear (r=0.02 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.04)); (7) parents’ HPV-related knowledge and awareness—HPV vaccine knowledge and awareness (r=0.14 (95% CI 0.05 to 0.23)) and cervical cancer/HPV knowledge (r=0.04 (95% CI 0.04 to 0.13)); and (8) sociodemographic factors—urban versus rural location (r=0.10 (95% CI 0.06 to 0.14)) and child’s age (r=0.07 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.13)). Factors negatively associated with parents’ uptake of HPV vaccines for their children were parents’ vaccine attitudes—HPV vaccine safety concerns (r=−0.31 (95% CI −0.41 to −0.16)); and insurance/cost—out-of-pocket cost (r=−0.15 (95% CI −0.22 to −0.07)).\n\nBetween-study variability\nThe small number of studies examining some of the factors precluded us from conducting subanalyses to assess the impact of risk of bias on the findings for those outcomes; therefore, we examined individual results to identify potential reasons for between-study variability. We found high heterogeneity in the reported correlations between parents’ HPV vaccine uptake for their children and the following factors: physician recommendation, intention to vaccinate child for HPV, HPV vaccine safety concerns, belief in vaccines in general, perceived HPV vaccine benefits, routine child preventive check-up, health insurance coverage of HPV vaccination, mother’s history of receiving a Pap test, HPV vaccine knowledge and awareness, and child age. We found medium heterogeneity in cervical cancer/HPV knowledge, and low heterogeneity in parents’ trust in healthcare provider, mother as HPV vaccine decision-maker (vs both parents), anticipatory regret, out-of-pocket cost for HPV vaccination, parent history of HPV, parent history of genital warts, parent or family history of abnormal Pap smear, and urban versus rural location.\n\nModerating factors of parents’ uptake of HPV vaccines for children\nWe conducted moderation analyses to examine whether the variance in HPV vaccine uptake could be explained by three covariates—sex of child, sex of parent and study risk of bias—after adjusting for other factors (eg, physician recommendation, health insurance coverage, HPV vaccine safety concerns and others). We found that the omnibus test for the effect of sex of parent on uptake of HPV vaccines yielded Q=10.41, df=2 (P=0.006); thus, controlling for sex of child and risk of bias, there is some evidence that effect size for parents’ uptake of HPV vaccines for their children may be related to the sex of the parent. More specifically, mothers/female guardians had a coefficient of −0.018, suggesting that uptake may be greater in studies that included mothers/female guardians as opposed to studies that included both mothers/female guardians and fathers/male guardians, controlling for sex of child and risk of bias. However, this model was not statistically significant (P=0.653).\n\nThe omnibus test for the effect of sex of child indicated Q=10.37, df=3 (P=0.016); therefore, controlling for sex of parent and risk of bias, there is some evidence that effect size for parents’ uptake of HPV vaccines for their children is related to the sex of the child. More specifically, we found a significant effect for preadolescent and adolescent girls and HPV vaccine uptake. The coefficient for girls of 0.096 (P=0.036) indicates that parents’ uptake of HPV vaccines for their children is greater in studies that included preadolescent and adolescent girls, as opposed to studies that included both preadolescent and adolescent girls and boys, controlling for sex of parent and risk of bias.\n\nWe found no significant moderating effect of study risk of bias on HPV vaccine uptake. The proportion of variance in uptake that is explained by all three covariates is 28%. The results of the various sensitivity analyses and examination of a funnel plot of the 62 studies included in the meta-analysis showed no publication bias (Begg and Mazumdar rank correlation, P=0.945).\n\nDiscussion\nThis systematic review and meta-analysis is among the first to assess correlates of parents’ HPV vaccine uptake for their children, rather than proxies such as HPV vaccine acceptability or intention to vaccinate. Results from 79 studies in 15 countries including over 840 000 parents indicate overall suboptimal parental uptake (41.5%) of one or more doses of HPV vaccines for their children. Notably, parents’ HPV vaccine uptake differed significantly by sex of the child: uptake for girls (46.5%) and in mixed samples of girls and boys (39.8%) was higher than uptake for boys (20.3%), indicating substantial sex disparities in uptake.\n\nParents’ overall modest levels of HPV vaccine uptake for their children more than a decade after the initial licensure of an HPV vaccine indicate the importance of synthesising evidence to support effective programmes to accelerate uptake. The disparities in uptake by sex of child are consistent with the later approval and recommendation of HPV vaccination for boys than girls in the USA, where the majority of studies were conducted, and the lack of coverage of HPV vaccination for boys in many other national insurance programmes.101 However, our findings also suggest a number of enduring factors that may contribute to sex disparities in HPV vaccine uptake. A predominant policy focus in many national public health strategies and funding mechanisms on increasing HPV vaccine coverage among girls and young women in order to achieve herd protection may contribute to a lack of perceived benefits of HPV vaccination for men on the part of parents, healthcare providers and boys/young men themselves101 102—despite the documented effectiveness and substantial health benefits of HPV vaccination for boys.9 36\n\nIn line with previous descriptive reviews largely focused on uptake for girls,12 103 physician recommendation had the single greatest effect on parents’ uptake of HPV vaccines for their children, supported by evidence from over 20 studies. As the first meta-analysis of HPV vaccine uptake, to our knowledge, to test for the moderating influence of child’s sex—and based on previous studies that suggest a tendency on the part of healthcare providers to offer HPV vaccine recommendations to those they perceive to be more likely to benefit from and to accept vaccination (ie, girls, patients with health insurance)104—this highlights the importance of physicians making recommendations for boys as well as girls in order to increase parents’ HPV vaccine uptake for their children.103 105 The vital role of physician recommendation of HPV vaccination for boys is further supported by the significant association (with evidence from 10 studies) of parents’ perceived HPV vaccine benefits with their uptake of HPV vaccines for their children, in the context of the enduring perception that HPV is a woman’s concern.102\n\nResults from meta-analyses indicate a substantial negative effect of parents’ concerns about HPV vaccine safety on HPV vaccine uptake for their children, as well as positive effects of belief in vaccines in general and perceived HPV vaccine benefits; each of these factors is supported by findings from 10 or more studies. These parental attitudes and beliefs about vaccines in general, and HPV vaccines in particular, may be strategic targets for both physician engagement with parents and for public health education campaigns in accelerating HPV vaccine uptake. Nevertheless, the broader phenomenon of vaccine hesitancy, evidenced in the USA106 and other countries,8 has resulted in parental resistance to childhood vaccinations, with a subsequent re-emergence of vaccine-preventable diseases in the USA.106 In the context of even greater scrutiny that may be applied to an adolescent vaccine for a sexually transmitted infection,8 the significant effects of parents’ attitudes and beliefs support the importance of careful and respectful healthcare provider engagement with parents and their concerns as a facilitator of HPV vaccine uptake.105 107 The positive impact of parents’ trust in healthcare providers on their uptake of HPV vaccines for their children, as similarly identified in regard to childhood vaccines,108 provides evidence to support the importance of the process of physician engagement in effectively communicating with parents.105 107 109 Findings from this review suggest a substantive focus on addressing parents’ HPV vaccine safety concerns and supporting their positive beliefs in the health benefits of vaccines in general, as well as explaining the particular benefits of HPV vaccines for their children, including boys and girls.\n\nRoutine child preventive check-up was identified across eight studies as being positively associated with parents’ HPV vaccine uptake for their children. It may be that the public health focus on routine gynaecological cancer screening in preventive care for women, with no analogously effective screening mechanism available for anal or oropharyngeal cancer among men, may thereby contribute to sex disparities in HPV vaccine uptake. This supports the importance of reducing missed opportunities in encounters with healthcare providers to promote HPV vaccine uptake for boys.103\n\nBeyond healthcare provider-related factors and parents’ attitudes and beliefs about vaccines, the significant impact of health insurance coverage of HPV vaccination and out-of-pocket cost on parents’ uptake of HPV vaccines for their children supports the important role of healthcare policy and funding in promoting HPV vaccine uptake.11 101 We also identified a small but significant effect of urban versus rural location on HPV vaccine uptake. These correlates of uptake underscore the importance of structural interventions, such as the US Vaccines for Children programme which provides vaccines at no cost to low-income children, and school-based HPV vaccine delivery programmes, such as in Australia (including boys and girls), which have helped to reduce disparities in uptake by children’s race/ethnicity, sex and socioeconomic status.110 They also suggest addressing rurality as a sociodemographic factor that may contribute to disparities in HPV vaccine uptake.\n\nMethodological considerations\nSeveral methodological issues pose limitations to this review, including the dearth of intervention studies, high risk of bias in the majority of studies reviewed and heterogeneity due to between-study variability. Some variables were meta-analysed across relatively few studies precluding subanalyses of moderator variables, or meta-regression, to assess the impact of risk of bias on the findings. However, we used random-effects models to account for methodological variability, assessed each study for risk of bias, assessed risk of bias as a moderator and calculated accepted statistical indices to assess heterogeneity, in accordance with PRISMA15 and MOOSE guidelines.16 Additionally, 10 of the 19 factors in meta-analyses were supported by findings from at least six or more studies, with six factors supported by findings from 10 or more studies.\n\nAn additional limitation is that the vast majority of studies focused on mothers, with very few studies assessing fathers’ HPV vaccine uptake for their children,90 98 and several failing to indicate the sex of the parent surveyed. Future studies should examine fathers’ uptake of HPV vaccines for their children, with parents’ uptake disaggregated by sex, and assess whether fathers’ support for HPV vaccination of their daughters and/or sons differs from that of mothers. Similarly, while nearly all studies reported ages of the children vaccinated, over a quarter did not report parents’ age(s) and many studies failed to include basic descriptive statistics on parents’ age (ie, mean or median, range). As many studies did not identify the type of physician who recommended HPV vaccination, future investigations should specify physician and healthcare provider type to assess differences among providers and specific practice implications. Understandably, some of the missing demographic data may be a result of limitations in national and regional immunisation registries; augmenting the information collected in these databases may provide further evidence to inform tailored interventions to increase parents’ HPV vaccine uptake for their children.\n\nFinally, parents’ uptake of HPV vaccines for their children may be affected by a reduction in the required number of doses to achieve full protection, as well as broad structural and social factors, including high-income versus low-income countries, public funding of HPV vaccination for girls and for boys, school-based versus clinic-based vaccination, HPV prevalence, and cultural differences. As we used HPV vaccine initiation as the primary outcome based on data reported in more than 90% of the studies reviewed, the same factors are likely to be associated with initiation of a two-dose regimen; the latter may help to mitigate to an extent the negative effects of out-of-pocket costs and perhaps parents’ safety concerns on uptake. We compared uptake in high-income versus low-income and middle-income countries; however, the paucity of studies in the latter context, including demonstration projects that may overestimate broader population uptake, may have limited statistical power to detect differences, and we were unable to systematically model other social-structural factors in this meta-analysis. Nevertheless, the significant effects of health insurance coverage and out-of-pocket cost on parents’ uptake of HPV vaccines for their children indicate the impact of national policies and funding mechanisms in the USA—where 9vHPV is now largely a standard of care for insurance companies—and other countries (with only 6% including HPV vaccines for boys in national immunisation programmes vs 37% for girls only).9 It is also crucial to expand investigations in low-income and middle-income countries, with the highest morbidity due to HPV-related cancers and the lowest access to and uptake of HPV vaccines.8\n\nThis systematic review and meta-analysis indicates overall suboptimal parental uptake of HPV vaccines for their children across 79 studies conducted in 15 countries, along with significant correlates of uptake at the level of healthcare providers, parental attitudes, beliefs and knowledge, and structural factors such as insurance coverage and out-of-pocket cost. Given the vital role of parents in HPV vaccine uptake for their children, public health strategies should address modifiable factors across multilevel domains that influence parents’ uptake. In particular, a focus on increasing provider, especially family physician,74 recommendation of HPV vaccines to parents of boys as well as girls, including during routine healthcare visits, may reduce sex disparities in HPV vaccine uptake and contribute to accelerating uptake overall.14 Further research including intervention studies and longitudinal designs, with results disaggregated by sex of children and parents, and by HPV vaccine initiation versus series (now two-dose) completion, is needed to advance evidence of factors associated with parents’ uptake of HPV vaccines for their children. Evidence-informed strategies that contribute to accelerating HPV vaccine uptake are critical to realising the full public health potential of HPV vaccines on cancer prevention."}

Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted through 5 electronic databases, including PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Medline, and PsycInfo from January 2006 to March 2015 for studies examining the uptake, awareness, knowledge, acceptability, and intention of adolescents with regard to HPV vaccination. Results: Twenty-eight studies were identified and included. The HPV vaccination uptake rate (at least 1 dose) varied significantly among countries, ranging from 2.4% to 94.4%. Scotland achieved the highest uptake of all the studies included in this review, while Hong Kong had the lowest, at 2.4% to 9.1%. This review also showed that adolescents had limited awareness and knowledge of HPV infections and vaccines, even 10 years after the vaccine had become available. Conclusions: It is recommended that barriers to the uptake of the vaccine should be addressed, and that school-based sexual health education of HPV infection and vaccine promotion should be reinforced.\nBackground\nHuman papillomavirus (HPV) infection creates a significant disease burden worldwide and is an important topic in public health. HPV infection is the most common sexually transmitted infection.1 It is estimated that 75% of sexually active people are infected with HPV during their lifetime.2 There are many genotypes of the HPV. HPV types 6 and 11 are the cause of 90% of cases of genital warts, whereas HPV types 16 and 18 are considered to be high-risk viruses, contributing to 70% of cases of cervical cancer.3 These virus subtypes will undergo cytopathologic changes, causing cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, which could eventually evolve to cervical cancer after approximately 2 decades.3\nCervical cancer is the fourth leading cause of female cancer and ranks as the second most common form of cancer globally among females aged 15 to 44 years.4 Cervical cancer accounted for 5.2% of the cancer burden worldwide, leading to 530 000 new cases and 270 000 deaths every year for the past decades.5 Apart from cervical cancer, HPV can cause precancerous lesions, anogenital warts and other cancers of the vulva, vagina, penis, anus, and oropharynx.6\nA prophylactic HPV vaccine was approved and licensed in 2006, and has been available since then, to prevent HPV associated infections targeting females aged 9 to 26 years.7 In late 2009, it was recommended that the quadrivalent HPV vaccine for males also be approved.8 By 2014, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved another new HPV vaccine to provide additional protection against more types of HPV.9\nMany countries now include the HPV vaccination in their national vaccination program.10 In 2007-2009, Australia successfully launched a national HPV vaccination program offering free vaccinations for females between the ages of 12 and 26 years. Three-dose coverage of the HPV vaccine among school girls aged 12 to 17 years was estimated to be 70% in 2009.11 As a result of the vaccination program, the incidence of genital warts has fallen sharply and nearly disappeared among young people. By 2011, the fourth year of the national vaccination program, cases of genital warts in women younger than 21 years declined from 18.6% to 1.9%, and from 22.9% to 2.9% in heterosexual men younger than 21 years.12 In the United States, private health insurance covers the cost of HPV vaccinations, while children under Medicaid are eligible and uninsured children are covered by the Vaccines for Children program.13\nAs many as 19 countries in Europe (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom) also introduced a program of routine HPV vaccinations in 2012. Coverage rates ranged from 17% to 84%, and 10 out of the 19 countries organized catch-up programs by May 2012.14 In Africa, a total of 21 developing countries have also implemented HPV vaccination projects among young girls under the support of a public-private partnership, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations since 2013. An estimated 206 000 girls from low-income countries are expected to benefit from these projects.15\nWith the widespread promotion of the HPV vaccine, HPV associated infections can be prevented.1 It is crucial that the HPV vaccine be administered prior to exposure to the virus, which is ideally before the initial incidence of sexual intercourse.16,17 Given that the first peak of HPV infection occurs when people are in their 20s,18 to protect against HPV infection, prophylactic HPV vaccination is being promoted for adolescents before they have begun engaging in sexual activity.\nFactors Contributing to the Uptake of HPV Vaccination\nSince the introduction of HPV vaccines, many studies have been conducted in different countries to examine the various factors affecting the uptake of vaccinations. Health-seeking behaviors are determined by a number of factors, including awareness and knowledge.19 Knowledge can be regarded as a prerequisite for informed decision making.20 The acceptability of a vaccine, defined as the willingness of an individual to be vaccinated, is another factor that contributes to its uptake.21 Numerous studies have been conducted in various countries on knowledge relating to HPV vaccination and its acceptability and uptake since the first vaccine was introduced. However, little is known about the comparison across various countries about the knowledge, acceptability, and uptake of HPV vaccination among adolescents. The vaccine uptake rate essentially determines the success of the coverage of HPV vaccination, which in the long run reduces the burden of diseases associated with HPV.\nPrior to this study, there was no systematic review of the uptake of HPV vaccination and its associated factors among adolescents. The aim of this review was to explore the uptake of the vaccination (including acceptability and intention), the associated factors (awareness and knowledge), and the facilitators of and barriers to HPV vaccination. The information in this systematic review will have significant implications for the drawing up of necessary health strategies/vaccination programs to promote the uptake of HPV vaccination.\nMethods\nThis systematic review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. The search strategy, inclusion and exclusion criteria, study selection approach, evaluation of the quality of the studies, and data extraction process are described below.\nSearch Strategy\nA comprehensive literature search was conducted using five electronic databases related to health care, namely, the PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Medline, and PsycInfo. Searches were limited to articles published between January 2006 and March 4, 2017, as the HPV vaccine has only been licensed since 2006. A search was conducted using the keywords: adolescen* OR girl* OR boy* OR male OR female OR parent*; AND human papillomavirus vaccine* OR HPV; AND uptake; AND knowledge* OR barrier* OR accept* OR intent*. Reference lists of review articles were retrieved to identify additional sources of literature.\nInclusion and Exclusion Criteria\nIncluded for consideration were studies published in the English language, original research articles including observational studies and quantitative studies, and articles that examined the uptake of HPV vaccination and associated factors such as the awareness, knowledge, acceptance, and intention of adolescents. Articles identified through the databases were excluded if they were in a language other than English or if no full-text version of the article was available. The following studies were excluded: studies that involved modeling, studies discussing the cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccines, conference proceedings, editorials, comments, letters, and conference abstracts; or articles that focused on the basic sciences, and not on the uptake of HPV vaccination. The studies that were included were first reviewed with a focus on the uptake of HPV vaccination, followed by an examination of associated factors including knowledge and acceptability.\nSelecting Studies in Accordance With PRISMA\nFigure 1 is the PRISMA flow diagram, which depicts the flow of literature selection process through different phases of the systematic review. A total of 911 articles were identified through a keyword search of 5 electronic databases, and an additional 6 articles were identified through a hand search. After the duplicates were removed, 618 articles remained.\n\nFigure 1. PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) flow diagram.\nThe articles were screen by examining the title and abstract according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. A total of 512 articles were excluded for the following reasons: no data on vaccination uptake (n = 136), provision of factual information on the HPV vaccine (n = 28), discussion of general attitudes toward HPV (n = 14), adolescents were not the target population (n = 67), and factual information on HPV infections and related diseases (n = 267).\nThe remaining 106 full-text articles were further assessed for eligibility, and a further 64 were excluded. Those that were excluded were qualitative studies (n = 2), studies in which adolescents were not the target population (n = 27), articles that contained factual information on the HPV vaccine (n = 2), articles that duplicated data in reports (n = 2), studies that did not provide data on population size (n = 21), articles in which the data provided in the text were inconsistent with the data in the resulting tables (n = 1), and articles that contained no report on uptake (n = 9). The remaining 42 studies were included in this review.\nEvaluation of the Quality of the Studies\nAfter the PRISMA selection process, the articles that were included underwent a critical appraisal. The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) checklist was used as the tool to appraise the quality of the selected articles.22 The CASP critical appraisal checklist is divided into 3 parts, which includes a total of 11 questions to assess the internal validity of the study the results, and the relevance of the results to practice. The first 2 items are screening questions to assess whether the study is relevant and worth assessing.22 Scores of 7 or higher in the CASP checklist are considered the threshold for “reasonable quality.”23 The critical appraisal was performed by 2 reviewers (MLK and AKYW) working independently. In the case of discrepancies, the 2 reviewers either tried to come to a consensus or brought in a third person to serve as a judge.\nAlmost all the articles that were included were considered to be of good quality (total score ≥7), with the exception of 4 studies that were assessed as being of moderate quality (see Supplementary Table 1 available online). Those 5 studies were included for their usefulness in expanding the global comparison made in this review.\nData Extraction\nThe process of extracting data was conducted by 2 reviewers working independently. The key information in these studies were extracted and tabulated, and included the following: the name of the author(s), the year of publication, and the country/region in which the study was conducted, the research objective(s), characteristics of the participants, age and gender of the adolescents, sample size, response rates, the study design, study setting, time frame for collecting the data, and key relevant findings (see Appendix I available online).\nResults\nThe process of selecting the literature is shown in the PRISMA flow diagram (Figure 1). Twenty-eight articles met the inclusion criteria were included in the review (see Appendix II available online).\nPopulations of the Included Studies\nOf the 42 studies, which focused on the HPV vaccination of adolescents, nearly half (22/42, 52.4%) had been conducted in the United States, 10 in Europe, including the United Kingdom (n = 3), 2 in Norway, and 1 each in the Netherlands, Germany, France, Denmark, and Latvia. Six studies were conducted in Asia, 3 of them in Hong Kong, and 1 each in Taiwan, Malaysia, and Japan. Canada and Australia each accounted for 1 study.\nAmong these studies, 28 focused on females, 6 on males, and 7 studies included both male and female adolescents. These adolescents ranged in age from 9 to 21 years. The number of participants ranged from 60 to 1 204 588. The sample size was large for some studies, since data were retrieved from the databases of government registries or surveillance programmes. In as many as 14 studies, the data were retrieved from national vaccination registries. Of the other 28 studies, 12 obtained data directly from the adolescent participants, 14 collected data by proxy from the adolescents’ parents or caregivers, and 2 from both the adolescents and their parents.

The study population included males, but no vaccine was offered to males at that time.\nc\nThe study by Caskey et al (2009) in the United States included both adolescent girls (13-17 years old) and young women (18-26 years old); only the data for the adolescent girls was included in this review.\nKey Findings\nThe key findings of the review focused on the uptake of the vaccination (including acceptability and intention), the associated factors (awareness and knowledge), and the facilitators of and barriers to HPV vaccination.\nVaccination Uptake\nAcceptability of the Vaccine\nOnly 2 studies examined the acceptability of HPV vaccination to adolescents—one from the United States24 and the other from Hong Kong25 (Table 1). Adolescents in Hong Kong reported a lower rate of acceptance (27.1%) of HPV vaccination in comparison with adolescents in the United States (52%). Two studies examined the acceptability of HPV vaccination—one from the United States26 and the other from Hong Kong.25 Parents who accepted the HPV vaccine rose from 27.5% in 2008 to 37.6% in 2012 in Hong Kong,25 but the rate of acceptance was lower than that reported in the United States (69.6%).26\nVaccine Intention\nVaccination intention can be considered an indication of how prepared a person is to take action to be vaccinated against HPV before any such action is actually taken. Only 4 studies examined the adolescents’ vaccination intention. Only moderate intention was observed in adolescents from Germany (44.6%), followed by Hong Kong (34.8%), and the United States (19%-43%).27-30 Fourteen studies examined the intention of parents to allow their child(ren) to be vaccinated against HPV. Twelve of those studies, conducted in the United States, reported a range of 32.7% to 82% of female adolescents, and 28% to 83.8% of male adolescents intended for vaccination.29-42\nActual Uptake\nVaccination uptake refers to the action of vaccinating against HPV. The studies reported on the uptake of HPV vaccines for 1 dose, and for the complete series of 3 doses (Table 1). Of the studies reported on the complete series, all but one only reported the proportion of those who received 2 doses.\nAll 42 studies reported on the proportion of adolescents who had received at least 1 dose of HPV vaccine, with the range varying greatly from 1.1% to 94.4%. At 94.4%, the UK-Scotland study achieved the highest HPV vaccination uptake rate, followed by Taiwan (91%), Prince Edward Island in Canada (87.4%), Australia (83%), Denmark (80%), and Malaysia (77.9%). The rates in Japan, the Netherlands, and Germany barely exceeded 50%. Of all the included studies, Hong Kong and another study from pan-Canada38 recorded the lowest uptake of 2.4% to 9.1%, and 1.1% respectively.\nOn the proportion of adolescents who received the complete series of the HPV vaccination, the range also varied greatly from 0.7% to 91.4%. Again, the UK-Scotland achieved the highest uptake here, at 91.4%, followed by Taiwan (89%), Prince Edward Island in Canada (81.4%), Australia (70%), and Denmark (62%), Japan (48.2%), and Germany (41%), France (range 23.7%-33.3%), and the United States (range 0.7%-27.7%). No report on the uptake of the complete series of the HPV vaccination was found in the studies conducted in Hong Kong.\nOnly 5 studies from the United States29,34,35,41,43 and 1 study from Canada38 reported the HPV vaccination rate among adolescent males. The uptake rate of US adolescent males was significantly lower (range 4.9%-31.7%) than that of US adolescent females (range 18%-45.4%). Among males, the rate of those who completed the vaccination series was also low (0.7%-4.0%) compared with that of females (5.5%-34.5%). Similar situation was found in Canada. The uptake rate of Canadian adolescent males was significantly lower (1.1%) than that of the adolescent females (65.1%).\nAssociated Factors: Awareness and Knowledge of HPV, Maternal Level of Education\nAwareness and knowledge of HPV were commonly measured together in these studies. Awareness was usually measured by determining whether the participants had ever heard of HPV (virus), the HPV vaccine, or cervical cancer. Knowledge was commonly measured by examining whether the participants had a deeper understanding of HPV-related infections, risk factors, and the route of transmission. The maternal level of education was also identified to be associated with the uptake of HPV vaccination.\nAwareness\nOnly 5 studies examined adolescent awareness of HPV (Table 2). These studies were conducted in Hong Kong,25,28 Malaysia,44 the United States,24 and Latvia.45 Only slightly more than a quarter of the adolescents in Hong Kong had ever heard of HPV (28.8%) and of the HPV vaccine (40.3%).25 Adolescents in Latvia45 had less awareness of HPV (21.5%) and HPV vaccine (9.9%) than those in Hong Kong. Girls in Malaysia reported a higher awareness of HPV infection (77.6%).44 Three studies reported that most of the adolescents had heard of cervical cancer (range 69%-95.9%).24,28,44\nTable 2.

The majority of them knew that an HPV infection will not always lead to cervical cancer (68%), and that cervical cancer is not always fatal (82%), and yet that unprotected sex will lead to a high risk of HPV infection (73%).49 Some girls knew that an HPV infection could cause genital warts (20%), yet that it could clear up on its own (5%).49\nIn Hong Kong, nearly all girls understood that cervical cancer is a common female cancer (92.9%).28 About half of them knew the purpose of the Pap test (52.8%), understood that HPV is a risk factor in cervical cancer (41.1%), and that the risk of developing cervical cancer increases with multiple sex partners (48.2%).28 Finally, only half of the girls had learned that cervical cancer can develop in any women who has engaged in sexual activity (52.5%).28 In the study conducted in the United Kingdom, only a mean score on HPV knowledge was given (8.87, SD = 2.29, range 0-15).50 In Latvia, slightly more than a quarter of adolescents knew that an HPV infection could cause genital warts (26.9%), but majority of them knew that HPV was a causative risk factor of cervical cancer (73.1%).45 Overall, the adolescents in the various countries had a limited understanding of HPV-related infections, risks, and consequences (Table 3).\nSeven studies conducted in the United States examined the knowledge of HPV among parents.26,33,34,46,39,40,42 Some parents knew that HPV could cause genital warts (25%), understood HPV as an STI (48%), and realized that the disease is asymptomatic (range 43%-62.3%, 2 studies).34,46 Nearly half of them knew that HPV can cause abnormal Pap smears (47%) and lead to cervical cancer (range 42.3%-70.4%). However, only 29% of the parents recognized that HPV can also cause oral and anal cancer (29%), and is a common infection during a person’s lifetime (41.6%).34,46\nSurprisingly, a range of 1.1% to 62.7% of parents were mistaken that only 1 HPV injection is needed for vaccination.40,42,46 One study measured their HPV knowledge by quantifying weighted scores.33 These studies indicate that, overall, US parents have a fair knowledge of HPV (Table 3).\nMaternal Level of Education\nThe maternal level of education was identified as a significant factor for the uptake of HPV vaccination.35,37,44,51-54 However, the influence of maternal education was not consistent across countries. In Canada, the United States, and Norway, parents with higher education were less likely to vaccinate their children against HPV.35,37,53,54 These parents were more likely to conduct an information search over the Internet when compared with less educated parents.37 By retrieving medical information on their own, educated parents felt confident about their ability to assess and weigh their daughters’ risk of contracting HPV infections, and to make the decision without consulting health care providers.37 Moreover, these educated parents felt comfortable about declining the offer to have their children vaccinated against HPV in a publicly funded programme, as they felt that they could purchase the vaccine themselves if they changed their mind in the future.37 However, other studies reported that parents with less education were more likely to accept such offers.44,52\nThe study conducted in Hong Kong reported that a higher level of maternal education was positively associated with the uptake of the HPV vaccine for children, with girls whose mothers had a tertiary education being more than twice more likely to be vaccinated against HPV than those with less educated mothers.51\nFacilitators of and Barriers to the Uptake of HPV Vaccination\nIn reviewing the literature, some common facilitating factors and barriers affecting the uptake of HPV vaccination were identified. They are listed in Table 4.\nTable 4. Facilitators of and Barriers to the Uptake of Human Papillomavirus Vaccination.\nFacilitators\tBarriers\n• Physician recommendation26,29,30,32-35,37,42-44,48,50,51\n• Parental acceptance36,46\n• Peer encouragement21,36\n• Health insurance coverage31,46\t• Cost of vaccine25,28,32,51-53\n• Parental concern:\n - Child not sexually active 32,36,51,53\n - Concern about the safety of the vaccine27,36,37,48,51,54\n - Think that vaccination will encourage sexual activity36,37,48\n• Lack of information31,32,36,38,40,47,53,54\n• Prefer to wait till their children are older37\nFacilitators\nOf the 42 articles, one-third reported that one of the major facilitators of HPV vaccination among adolescents was the recommendation of a physician or other health care provider.26,29,30,32-35,37,42-44,48,50 Doctors and health care providers were reported to be the most trusted source of health information for parents.48,55 It was also reported that their recommendation was a major reason why parents decided to have their child vaccinated against HPV.26,30,32,34,35,37,43,44,48 Other facilitators of HPV vaccination were parental acceptance,36,46 peer encouragement,21,36 and health insurance coverage.31,46\nVaccination programmes, school-based and community-based, was also identified as a facilitator for HPV vaccination.37,51,56-60 A school-based vaccination programme can achieve a vaccination uptake rate of 65.1% to 94.4% for at least 1 dose, as seen in Taiwan, Australia, Canada, Scotland, and Norway.37,53-56,58,60 These studies supported that implementing HPV vaccination through a school-based approach is an effective way of reaching targets directly. Parents are also easily contacted for consent, and schools can be the ideal channel for health promotion and education.58 HPV vaccine uptake rates in non–school-based HPV vaccination programmes were lower.57,61 The coverage in a non–school-based vaccination approach implemented among 14-year-old girls in France was 50.8% in 2007, 41.7% in 2008, and 20.5% in 2009, with 65% of the cost of the vaccination reimbursable by National Health Insurance.59\nDenmark’s offer of free vaccinations for eligible young girls in the community resulted in uptakes of 80%, 75%, and 62% for the first dose, second dose, and third dose, respectively, in 2009.61 In Japan, a publicly funded clinic-based vaccination programme in Shiki City for girls aged 11 to 15 years achieved the coverage rates of 64.8%, 62.7%, and 48.2% for first, second, and third dose.57\nBarriers\nThe cost of the vaccine and parental concerns were the reasons why the parents did not get their children vaccinated against HPV. The cost of HPV vaccines is a major obstacle to the uptake of vaccination, and this was reported in 6 studies.25,28,32,51,52,55 Two studies conducted in the United States reported that health insurance coverage was significantly associated with HPV vaccination, as uninsured girls had the lowest rate of vaccination.32,55 The study in Hong Kong revealed that parents and adolescent girls were concerned about the high cost of the vaccine, and that low-income families may not be able to afford the HPV vaccination if they had to pay for the entire cost themselves.25,51 Parents were willing to get their children vaccinated if the cost of the HPV vaccination was more affordable.25,52\nParental concerns about the safety of the HPV vaccine and its potential side effects were reported to hinder the uptake of vaccination from studies conducted in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Canada, given that the vaccine is relatively new in the market.62\nMany parents believed that their children were at low risk of contracting an HPV infection. Many felt that their children were too young to be sexually active or believed that their children were sexually inactive, and regarded the HPV vaccination as unnecessary.32,36,52,55 Some parents were also concerned that vaccination would encourage their children to become sexually active, as the children would believe that they were protected from contracting STIs.36,37,48 Many parents were reluctant to vaccinate their children at a young age and would prefer to wait until their children are older.37 In addition, many of the parents complained that they had insufficient information and knowledge to make an informed decision.31,32,36,38,40,47,52,62\nDiscussion\nThis is the first literature review to explore the trends and factors in the uptake of HPV vaccination among adolescents worldwide.\nThe studies that were included indicated a moderate level of awareness of the HPV vaccine; however, the knowledge of adolescents and parents regarding HPV infections was insufficient. Having knowledge is known to influence the uptake of the HPV vaccine, and many parents said that they did not have enough information to make an informed choice. It was reported in a study in Hong Kong that the major reason for the low vaccination uptake rate among adolescents was their lack of knowledge about the HPV vaccine.51 A better understanding of HPV infections and the importance of vaccination may increase the acceptability of HPV vaccination in the eyes of adolescents and parents, and thus its uptake by adolescents.\nAs the public generally considered the health information and recommendations that they received from their physicians to be trustworthy, physicians should be invited to give public talks on HPV-related infections and HPV vaccines. In this review, a physician’s recommendation was identified as one of the key facilitators for the uptake of HPV vaccines. Health care professionals and the government should put more effort into health promotions and education to prevent HPV infections and encourage vaccination.\nAlthough the HPV vaccine has been available on the market for almost 10 years, coverage is still low. The global coverage of polio, measles, and hepatitis B immunizations has been estimated to be more than 80%.63 The HPV vaccine uptake rate for the first dose varies among countries, from 1.1% to 94.4%. Most countries have attained more than 50% coverage for at least first dose. Disappointingly, the coverage of HPV vaccination in the highly developed United States and Hong Kong is still low.\nIt was found that the uptake of the HPV vaccine is significantly related to the issues of cost and affordability. The HPV vaccine is expensive for low-income families, costing US$130 per dose and $390 for the full series.13 In this review, a high uptake rate was observed in countries with publicly funded HPV vaccination programs, such in the United Kingdom and Australia. Removing the barrier of cost is likely to be an effective strategy for raising vaccination rates, and may prevent millions of premature deaths or unnecessary disability. Governments should consider including the HPV vaccine in their childhood routine immunization schedule on a voluntary basis, or providing a financial subsidy to increase the affordability of the vaccine.\nA discrepancy between genders in the HPV vaccine uptake rate has been observed in studies conducted among US and Canadian adolescents. Female adolescents were significantly more likely than males to receive at least one dose and the complete series, which is consistent with previous literature.64,65 Only 4 out of the 42 studies examined the awareness, knowledge, and intention of parents to vaccinate their boys. Adolescent boys were a neglected population in related studies. Besides the most common association between HPV and cervical cancer in females, many may not be aware that genital warts and oropharyngeal cancer is caused by HPV infections in males.\nThe general public mistakenly regards HPV infection as a women’s disease, since the HPV vaccine was initially approved for females aged 9 to 26 years.64 It was 3 years later, in 2009, that approval for the use of quadrivalent HPV vaccine was extended to males, and its routine recommendation was issued by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices in 2011.8 Many parents regard HPV as irrelevant to boys, and only mattering to females, leading to the “feminization” of HPV.66 In fact, HPV infection is a common type of sexually transmitted infection that affects males and females in equal measure.67 Promotions of HPV vaccines and health education should be targeted at young females and males, as well as their parents.\nLimitations\nThis study has few limitations. Because of the heterogeneity of the population and the inconsistent variables, the results could not be pooled in this review for statistical significance. There were few studies examining the knowledge of parents toward HPV, which can affect the rate at which adolescents get vaccinated against HPV.\nMost studies focused on awareness and knowledge, as if awareness and knowledge would have direct effects on uptake. Most studies included in the review were conducted in Western countries (eg, the United States), with fewer studies from Asia and none from Africa. The authors could only compare and retrieve what had been included in these studies. Also included were studies that mostly focused on the female adolescent population, with less attention paid to males, thus limiting the ability to make comparisons between genders. Numerous different tools were used to measure the same variables (such as knowledge, awareness, etc), making it difficult to make direct comparisons between studies.\nImplications for Practice\nSchools are a very good channel to reach adolescents. School-based sexual health education should be strengthened.48,68 For example, periodic talks on sexual health should be arranged in secondary schools to spread health messages, and posters could be displayed to raise awareness. Annual physical examinations could also be offered through the student health service, as part of health education in schools. Booklets and pamphlets about HPV infections could be distributed to students, with explanations by physicians and individual health counselling.\nCost is the major barrier to the uptake of HPV vaccination, as was reported in many studies.25,28,51 Many developed countries, such as Australia and Canada, have already included HPV vaccines in their publicly funded national immunization program. Governments should consider offering free HPV vaccinations, as with childhood immunization programs. To have better access to young girls, it is suggested that HPV vaccines be administered through a school-based approach. From the public health perspective, HPV vaccination is a worthwhile prophylactic measure for a government to subsidize to prevent HPV-associated infections and severe illnesses. The cost of vaccination will certainly be more than compensated for by the future savings in medical costs, as well as by improvements in the health of the public in the long run.\nIn Hong Kong, HPV vaccination is still an out-of-pocket expense. The high cost of vaccination has resulted in low uptake over the years. No recommendations on the use of HPV vaccines in Hong Kong at the population level were made in the report by the Scientific Committee on Vaccine Preventable Diseases under the Centre for Health Protection.69 Since September 2013, Macau, a neighboring city of Hong Kong, has also been offering free HPV vaccinations to adolescent girls.70 It is recommended that the Government of Hong Kong consider doing the same for girls in Hong Kong.\nWith regard to the implications for research, further studies should be carried out to examine the relationship between the uptake of HPV vaccination and HPV infection rates and the trend in cervical cancer rates in the future. Since the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended in 2011 that the HPV vaccine be administered to males, there will be more studies focusing on the male population. A future review could compare the differences between males and females with respect to their awareness, knowledge, and acceptance of HPV vaccination, their intention to get vaccinated against HPV, and their actual uptake of HPV vaccination.\nConclusions\nThe vaccine uptake is still low in various countries. Both adolescents and their parents had limited awareness and knowledge of HPV infections and vaccines, even 10 years after the vaccine had become available. It is recommended that barriers to uptake of the vaccine should be addressed, and that school-based sexual health education of HPV infection and vaccine promotion should be reinforced.\n"}

Perceived barriers including accessibility and cost concerns were important for acceptance, as were cues to action from healthcare providers and governments.\nConclusions\nThis review suggests that acceptability of the HPV vaccine in countries in this region will be high. Broad knowledge gaps were highlighted regarding HPV and cervical cancer and these should be addressed. Education on the vaccine's effectiveness and reducing perceived barriers to vaccination would also be useful. Public endorsement by governments and healthcare providers will likely also increase acceptance.\nIntroduction\nThe quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is manufactured by Merck & Co. and has been available commercially since 2006. The vaccine protects against strains of HPV that cause approximately 70% of cervical cancer cases and 90% of anogential wart cases worldwide. The cost is high (approximately $400 US for a three-series dose) and until recently this presented a significant barrier to implementation within low-resource countries. The Global Alliance for Vaccine Initiatives (GAVI) recently negotiated a $4.50/dose fee for GAVI-supported countries. At the same time, GAVI announced support for eight projects in African countries that will begin over 2013–2014 (GAVI, 2013). This is positive as in the past there have been decades of delay between new vaccine production and implementation in developing countries (Kane et al., 2006).\nAfrican countries carry the largest burden of cervical cancer worldwide. Globally, the prevalence of HPV infection is estimated at 11–12%; however in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) the estimate is substantially higher at 24% (Forman et al., 2012). In 2008, world estimates of new cervical cancer cases were 530,000, and 75,000 of these were from SSA countries, representing almost 15% of the world's burden (Forman et al., 2012). This burden is largely due to the lack of organized, preventative services, such as cytological screening (i.e. Pap smears), and the prevalence of risk factors for the disease (Bosch and de Sanjosé, 2003, Sankaranarayanan and Ferlay, 2006). Coinfection with HIV also increases the risk of HPV infection and progression by substantially reducing immunity (Palefsky et al., 2006). Promisingly, widespread vaccination with the HPV vaccine is expected to substantially reduce the burden of cervical cancer, especially when combined with other preventative measures (Garnett et al., 2006).\nHealth behaviors are conceptually complex and a number of frameworks have been used for their explanation. One that has been used to understand vaccination and cervical cancer screening behaviors in the past is the Health Belief Model (HBM) (Allen et al., 2010, Brewer and Fazekas, 2007, Johnson et al., 2008, Prematunge et al., 2012). As an expectancy model, the HBM predicts that an individual's health behavior will depend on the value placed on achieving a goal and the belief that a certain behavior will achieve that goal (Poss, 2001). The model includes aspects of perceived likelihood (individual susceptibility), perceived severity, and perceived effectiveness and benefits. There are also cues to action (external or internal stimuli) and perceived barriers to action. In this review, in addition to these five constructs, HPV vaccine-related awareness and knowledge and other modifying factors previously found to predict acceptability are included.\nThe purpose of this paper is to present a systematic review of peer-reviewed literature on the factors associated with HPV vaccine acceptability among adults with and without children from African countries. Acceptability in this context refers to a reported/predicted willingness and intention to receive a vaccination, and not actual uptake. A systematic review similar to this topic has been published recently (Perlman et al., 2014); however the current review is unique in its focus on adults, the quantification of results and use of the HBM framework which allows comparability to a previous US review (Brewer and Fazekas, 2007).\nAccess through your organization\nCheck access to the full text by signing in through your organization.\n\nSection snippets\nSearch strategy\nA health sciences librarian with experience conducting systematic reviews assisted with the search of five electronic databases: EMBASE, PsychINFO, CINAHL, Global Health and Ovid MEDLINE (August 2013). All literature relating to HPV vaccination in African countries was sought and the search consisted of database-specific vocabulary and use of Boolean operators for: human papillomavirus vaccin* and Africa. No restriction was placed on date or language. Reference sections of included articles\nResults\nAs shown in Fig. 1, 229 unique articles were identified after database searches, 29 were given full-text review with 14 meeting inclusion criteria. One article was identified by hand-searching (Ports et al., 2013). The final number of articles included in this review is 15 representing 14 unique studies (Table 1).

Recent announcements from the GAVI of HPV vaccine demonstration projects beginning in SSA offer an encouraging step toward this goal.

Understanding their knowledge about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), intentions to use the COVID-19 vaccine, and its associated factors will help develop promising strategies in vaccine promotion concerning the current COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMethods: A cross-sectional online survey was carried out among students in the healthcare and non-healthcare sectors to assess their intentions to get vaccinated against the COVID-19. A non-probability snowball sampling technique was used to recruit study participants (N = 655) through social media platforms and emails. Study participants were recruited across the country, including six major geographical regions (Eastern, Western, Northern, Southern, North-east, and Central) in India between November 2020 and January 2021 before the introduction of the COVID-19 vaccine. Descriptive statistics were used to present the sociodemographic, and vaccine-related behaviors of the study participants. Key determinants that likely predict vaccine acceptance among students were modeled using logistic regression analysis. For each analysis, p < 0.05 was considered significant.\n\nResults: A total of 655 students were recruited, 323 from healthcare and 332 from non-healthcare sectors, to assess their intentions to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Of the 655 students, 63.8% expressed intentions to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. The acceptance was higher among non-healthcare students (54.07 vs. 45.93%). At the time of the study, 27.8% of the students indicated that they had been exposed to a confirmed COVID-19 patient. A vast majority (93.4%) of the students knew about the COVID-19 virus, and most (89.3%) of them were aware of the development of a COVID-19 vaccine. The history of vaccine hesitancy was found to be low (17.1%). Only one-third (33.4%) of the students showed concern about contracting COVID-19. Trust in the healthcare system [adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 4.13; (95% CI: 2.83–6.04), p < 0.00] and trust in domestic vaccines [aOR: 1.46; (95% CI: 1.02–2.08), p < 0.05] emerged as the significant predictors of student's intention to get vaccinated. Higher acceptance for vaccine was observed among students in the non-healthcare [aOR: 1.982; 95% CI: 1.334–2.946, p < 0.00].\n\nConclusion: This study shows that the Indian college students had relatively high levels of positive intentions to receive COVID-19 vaccines, although about one-third were not sure or unwilling to receive the vaccine, highlighting possible vaccine hesitancy. Informational campaigns and other strategies to address vaccine hesitancy are needed to promote uptake of COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nKeywords: COVID-19, students, vaccine hesitancy, vaccine uptake, vaccine intention, first wave\n\nIntroduction\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has continued to affect multiple domains of human lives since its emergence at theend of 2019 (1). The increasing cases of COVID-19 had an adverse effect on all spheres of life, the economy, and the environment during the lockdown period (2). On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared an outbreak, a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (3). The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected the lives of college students physically, academically, financially, and psychologically (4). To prevent widespread transmission of the COVID-19 virus among college staff and the young adult population, higher-education institutions across the country have rapidly switched from in-person to online learning (5). Growing attention has been paid to vaccinate high-risk populations to control the COVID-19 pandemic. Young adults and students are critical populations for the vaccination campaign and could act as messengers in delivering effective messages for better uptake of vaccines among their families and communities (6). Students in the healthcare sector are considered to have high-risk exposures to COVID-19 and have been given priority in vaccine allocations (6). In India, the COVID-19 vaccine was introduced in a phased manner with the first phase focused on healthcare workers, frontline workers, and populations at high risk as part of concerned control measures (7). Covishield (Serum Institute of India) and Covaxin (Bharat Biotech) were the two vaccines approved for restricted emergency use (8, 9). However, at the time of the study, acceptance of these vaccines remained skeptical, with safety (10) and efficacy (11) as major concerns. Students and younger populations seemed to play an important role in determining vaccine acceptance in the community, with contrasting effects in different countries (12), but information on the same was lacking in India.\n\nVaccine hesitancy was a significant issue even before the COVID-19 pandemic (13). The WHO considered this phenomenon as one of the top ten threats in global health in 2019. The available evidence seems to show that the intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19 is lower among younger adults and young people (14). Younger individuals may believe that COVID-19 poses a less serious threat to themselves than to other age groups (15). To attain complete protection from the COVID-19 viruses, the vaccines need to be widely accepted by all subgroups of the populations, including youth (16). In the United States of America (USA), though it reported the highest number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in 2020, only half of the medical students expressed willingness to participate in a vaccine trial and about 23% were hesitant to get vaccination (17). Similarly, only 35% of the medical students in Egypt (18), 45% of nursing students in Europe (19), and 52.8% of college students in New Jersey, USA, indicated their intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine (4). Although, a majority (86.1%) of the university students in Italy were willing to receive COVID-19 vaccine (20). Numerous studies reported that lack of trust in healthcare and/or health officials are common barriers to vaccination (21–23). However, there is a lack of such information from India on the prevalence of vaccination intentions and the reasons for such intentions among students in India.\n\nGiven that students could play an essential role in the global vaccination campaign by influencing the vaccination intentions of their families and communities, their perception and acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines, including factors associated with those intentions, need to be investigated. Accordingly, we conducted a study to assess the intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine and predictors of uptake among students in India. The findings from this study could help policymakers to prioritize strategies for effective interventions to promote vaccination among college students.\n\nMethods\nStudy Design and Sample\nA cross-sectional study was conducted among college students including healthcare and non-healthcare sectors across India. The survey was conducted between November 2020 and January 2021 during the “first wave” and before the introduction of COVID-19 vaccines in India. Students (N = 655) were recruited from an online survey via a self-reported questionnaire through social media, like WhatsApp, Facebook, and Twitter. Thus, primarily a convenient sampling technique was used. Further, the snowball sampling technique was used for enlisting additional participants, where the invited participants were requested to pass on the invitations to their peers. The minimum required sample size was estimated to be 576 with a 50% acceptance rate, 5% absolute precision, and 95% confidence level. The design effect was kept at 1.5. We recruited a total of 655 students of which 323 students were from healthcare and 332 students were from non-healthcare sectors. Participants aged 18 years or above who are currently living in India were included in the study. An online informed consent was obtained from all the participants before the survey. Only those provided the informed consent were taken to the questionnaire web page to initiate the survey.\n\nStudy Questionnaire\nThe questionnaire was informed by a literature review of similar studies (24, 25). The survey assessed various domains, such as (1) previous immunization behaviors; (2) perception of vaccines; (3) current knowledge about COVID-19 and personal experiences about COVID-19; and (4) sociodemographic characteristics, including age, sex, marital status, educational status, family size and income, social status, religion, caste, and residence. Some of the key questions that were asked include whether “they ever refused a vaccine for themselves or a child considering it as useless or dangerous”; “if they ever postponed a vaccine recommended by the physician” for assessing the general perception toward vaccine; “before the interview if they were aware of the COVID-19 virus that is currently circulating in the community”; “Is there currently any vaccine being prepared for the pandemic Coronavirus strain”; “do you have any history of staying or traveling with confirmed COVID-19 patient”; and “how concern are you that your family member will be infected with COVID-19 virus,” for estimating the current knowledge and personal experience about COVID-19.\n\nStatistical Analysis\nDescriptive analysis was conducted for socio-demographic characteristics of the responses to the survey. The age variable was categorized into three groups: 18–25, 26–35, and above 35 years. Gender was coded as a binary variable (male and female). Marital status was grouped into two categories (married and single). The educational status was categorized into three groups (postgraduate, graduate, and high school/diploma). Five response options were provided to family monthly income < INR 5,000 (about USD 71), 5,000–10,000, 11,000–20,000, 21,000–50,000, and >50,000. The geographical region of India was grouped into six categories (East, West, North, South, Central, and North-east), and the place of residence was categorized into urban vs. rural. “Yes” and “no” options were used for categorizing responses to certain questions, such as previous immunization behavior, perception of vaccines, awareness about COVID-19, and personal experience concerning COVID-19. In addition, they were asked “How concerned you are that you or someone in your family will be infected with COVID-19 virus?” and the responses were recorded in a three-point Likert scale (very concerned, somewhat concerned, and not at all concerned). “Do you have trust in the healthcare system to manage the current situation related to COVID-19?” was categorized into very likely, somewhat likely, and not at all. Bivariate analysis was conducted between all variables with the dependent variable of interest. Multiple logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine the association between the students receiving the COVID-19 vaccine with their sociodemographic and vaccination behaviors. A p < 0.05 was considered significant. Data analysis was conducted using Stata 15 software (STATA Corporation, College Station, TX, USA).\n\nEthical Consideration\nThe study was approved by the Institutional Research Ethics Committee of the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, India. All participants provided informed consent. Steps were taken to ensure confidentiality and privacy of the information provided by the participants, and only de-identified data were used.\n\nResult\nA total of 655 students participated in the study, with 49.3% from healthcare sectors and 50.6% from non-healthcare sectors. Of these 655 students, 42.8 and 22.4% belonged to the Northern and Eastern parts of India, respectively. Around 43.2% were graduates, and 41.1% were postgraduate students. About half of the students were in the age group of 18–25 years (54.0%). About three-fifths (61.9%) were women and 68.5% were unmarried. A majority (79.7%) of students belonged to middle socioeconomic status, with (41.0%) reporting a family monthly income of >INR 50,000 (about USD 710) (Table 1).\n\nTable 1.\nSocio-demographic characteristics of the study participants (N = 655).\n\nVariables\tn (%)\nAge (in years)\t\n    18–25\t390 (59.54%)\n    26–35\t242 (36.95%)\n    above 35\t23 (3.51%)\nGender\t\n    Male\t249 (38.02%)\n    Female\t406 (61.98%)\nStudents' category\t\n    Healthcare sector\t323 (49.31%)\n    Non-healthcare sector\t332 (50.69%)\nHighest education\t\n    Diploma/higher secondary school\t99 (15.11%)\n    Undergraduate\t287 (43.82%)\n    Postgraduate\t269 (41.07%)\nMarital status\t\n    Married\t198 (30.23%)\n    Single\t457 (69.77%)\nFamily size\t\n    Five and below\t517 (78.93%)\n    Six and above\t138 (21.07%)\nFamily income (INR/month)\t\n    below 10,000\t79 (12.06%)\n    11,000–20,000\t110 (16.79%)\n    21,000–50,000\t198 (30.23%)\n    above 50,000\t268 (40.92%)\nSocial status in the community*\t\n    Low\t66 (10.08%)\n    Medium\t522 (79.69%)\n    High\t67 (10.23%)\nGeographical region in India\t\n    Eastern\t147 (22.44%)\n    Western\t55 (8.40%)\n    Northern\t280 (42.75%)\n    Southern\t50 (7.63%)\n    Central\t60 (9.16%)\n    North-east\t63 (9.62%)\nPlace of residence\t\n    Urban\t309 (47.18%)\n    Rural\t346 (52.82%)\nOpen in a new tab\n*Self-reported information about perceived social status in participants neighborhood.\nMost (93.4%) of the participants were aware that the COVID-19 virus was circulating in the community; 89.3% of the students were aware that a “COVID-19 vaccine” was being prepared. About a little less than two-thirds (64.5%) of the students reported having trust in the healthcare system of India, and a little more than half (56.0%) reported having confidence in domestic vaccines. About 27.7% of students reported having had a history of travel or contact with a confirmed COVID-19 patient. Only one-third (33.4%) of the students were concerned about contracting the COVID-19 virus. A large proportion of students (82.9%) did not have any history of vaccine hesitancy (Table 2). A majority (89.3%) of the students knew that COVID-19 vaccines were being developed, had trust in the healthcare system (64.5%) and domestic vaccines (56.0%). Only about one-third (33.4%) perceived themselves at risk of contracting Coronavirus infection (Table 2).\n\nTable 2.\nDescriptive statistics on knowledge, risk perception, trust on the healthcare system, and perception toward domestic COVID-19 vaccine among the study participants (N = 655).\n\nVariables\tn (%)\nExposed to COVID-19 cases\t\n    No\t473 (72.21%)\n    Yes\t182 (27.79%)\nAwareness about COVID-19\t\n    No/not sure\t43 (6.56%)\n    Yes\t612 (93.44%)\nAwareness about development of COVID-19 vaccines\t\n    No/not sure\t70 (10.69%)\n    Yes\t585 (89.31%)\nHistory of vaccine hesitancy\t\n    Yes\t112 (17.10%)\n    No\t543 (82.90%)\nRisk perception\t\n    Yes\t219 (33.44%)\n    No\t436 (66.56%)\nTrust in the healthcare system\t\t\n    No\t232 (35.42%)\n    Yes\t423 (64.58%)\nTrust in domestic vaccines\t\t\n    No\t288 (43.97%)\n    Yes\t367 (56.03%)\nOpen in a new tab\nIn bivariate analysis, intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine seems to be slightly higher among non-healthcare sector students than among healthcare sector students (68.1 vs. 59.4%, p = 0.02), higher among unmarried students when compared to those who were single (33.9 vs. 66.0%), and higher among postgraduate (42.8%) and undergraduate students (40.1%) when compared to diploma/higher secondary students (Table 3).

However, none have reported uptake of COVID-19 vaccine among students, especially those in the healthcare sector. This study is one of the first studies that examined the willingness of hypothetical vaccine for COVID-19 among students in India.\n\nOur findings indicate a relatively good level of willingness (63.8%) among the healthcare and non-healthcare sectors to receive COVID-19 vaccines. However, the low or lack of intention to vaccinate among one-third of the sample in this study indicate vaccine hesitancy that needs to be tackled. Our findings are in line with the percentages of students (35–52.8%) who reported willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine in European countries and the USA (4, 18). In this study, we also found that the students in the non-healthcare sector were more willing to receive COVID-19 vaccines (54.0%) than those in the healthcare sector (45.9%). We also found that trust in the healthcare system and domestic vaccines was related to intention to receive COVID-19 vaccines. This finding of ours is similar to a survey conducted among college students in South Carolina, where 73.9% of students trust healthcare authorities, and that trust was significantly associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance (31). While this study found high levels of trust in domestic vaccines and their association with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, a study conducted in China reported that imported vaccine was preferred over domestic vaccine (32). Concerning the risk perception for COVID-19 infection, in this study, the participants reported a lower risk perception of getting infected, possibly reflecting an optimism bias, our expectations (low risk of infection) are better than reality (actual risk of infection) (15, 33).\n\nIn multivariable analysis, age, gender, and education were not significantly associated with vaccine acceptance. This finding contrasts with the results of other studies conducted in Portugal (23) and Indonesia (34), where vaccine acceptance was significantly associated with education and marital status, respectively; a lower intention to be vaccinated against COVID-19 among women was also reported (35). Perceived adverse events of the COVID-19 vaccine could be a possible reason for hesitancy, as highlighted by various studies among university students and the general population (18, 31). Studies have shown that adverse events and poor vaccine efficacy could be possible reasons for vaccination hesitancy among medical students (36). Studies among other populations too have reported several reasons for hesitancy toward COVID-19 vaccines, including side-effects of the vaccine (37), speed of development of the vaccine (38), uncertainty about the effectiveness (39), and effective duration of the vaccine, and medical mistrust (40).\n\nStudents are considered as trusted influencers and ambassadors for vaccine promotion (41). Vaccine hesitancy among students, especially those in the healthcare sector, and other priority groups has potentially negative consequences to themselves and may influence vaccine acceptance among the general population (42). For example, one study reported that vaccinated healthcare providers were more likely to recommend vaccination to their patients (41).\n\nThis study has several limitations. First, being a cross-sectional study, the predictors of vaccine acceptance may not be causal and may only reflect potential associations through unknown mechanisms. However, the identified significant predictors are in line with the potential mechanisms of vaccine acceptance documented in the literature. Nevertheless, the intention to receive COVID-19 vaccines may vary over time and structural contexts. Second, the study used convenient and snowball sampling to recruit participants, and thus the results may not be generalizable to all students of healthcare and non-healthcare sectors. Third, an online self-administered questionnaire form was used instead of a face-to-face interview, with potential bias in reporting; however, studies in the health field have shown that there may not be a difference between a self-administered and interviewer-administered questionnaire (43, 44). The reasons for the refusal or low willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccines need further investigation, possibly using qualitative or mixed methods approaches. Despite these limitations, this study provides critical information on the factors that impact the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination among college students in India. Furthermore, the data presented in this study could act as a piece of baseline information for future comparisons, i.e., how the intention to vaccinate varied over time.\n\nConclusion\nIn this study, we found suboptimal levels of willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccines, with nearly one-third not sure or willing to receive a vaccine, indicating high levels of potential vaccine hesitancy. Trust in the healthcare system, including vaccine safety and effectiveness, was a significant factor for COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among students. It is pertinent to design an evidence-based strategy to promote the uptake of vaccination among students, which could include informational campaigns that address vaccine hesitancy. In addition, strategies demonstrating the effectiveness and safety of the vaccine will be essential when rolling out the COVID-19 vaccination programs and those strategies will certainly have implications beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nData Availability Statement\nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/supplementary material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author.\n\nEthics Statement\nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by Institutional Research Ethics Committee of Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education & Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, India.

However, it will be a challenge to produce and implement a new vaccine when a novel highly pathogenic influenza virus emerges in humans as significant infections. H7 subtype influenza viruses have similar epitopes on hemagglutinin, which can induce cross-reactive antibodies. In this study, a meta-lysis of the cross-reactivity of antibodies induced by one H7 subtype influenza vaccine against other H7 subtypes was performed.\"\"All assessed H7 influenza vaccines induced vaccine strain-specific protective antibodies [seroconversion rate (SCR) = 0.74, 95% CI (0.65, 0.82); seroprotection rate (SPR) = 0.81, 95% CI (0.78, 0.83)]. All H7 influenza virus monovalent vaccines exhibited cross-reactivity tested by hemagglutinin inhibition test (HI), microneutralization test (MN) and immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to other H7 subtype viruses. H7N1, H7N3, H7N7, and H7N9 vaccines elicited cross-reactive antibodies against other H7 subtype influenza viruses [SCR = 0.66, 95% CI (0.50, 0.82); SPR = 0.79, 95% CI (0.67, 0.91)].\"\n\"Cardioprotective effects of influenza vacction among patients with established cardiovascular disease or at high cardiovascular risk: a systematic review and meta-lysis\"\"The clinical impact of the influenza vacction on cardiovascular outcomes in people with established cardiovascular disease (CVD) is still debated.

Many countries recommend vacction against influenza to prevent influenza infections, in particular for groups at high risk for complications [4-7]. Some high risk groups, such as young children and elderly persons (commonly defined as those above 65 years of age), experience decreased influenza vaccine effectiveness compared with healthy adults [8,9], complicating influenza prevention strategies.\"\"Studies assessing the protective effect of influenza vacction vs no influenza vacction (either no vacction, placebo or altetive vaccine) on contacts of any age group in a non-healthcare setting were eligible.\"\n\"Comparative Immunogenicity of Enhanced Seasl Influenza Vaccines in Older Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-lysis\"\"A number of enhanced influenza vaccines have been developed for use in older adults, including high-dose, MF59-adjuvanted, and intradermal vaccines.\"\"We searched the online databases of PubMed, MEDLINE, and EMBASE to identify potential studies using a combtion of all 5 of the following search terms in “all fields”: (1) influenza, (2) vaccine or vacction, (3) elderly or older adults, (4) immune or immunogenicity, and (5) adjuvanted or high dose or high-dose or MF59 or intradermal.\"\n\"Immunogenicity of The Influenza Vaccine in Multiple Sclerosis Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-lysis\"\"However, it has not yet been confirmed whether the dysfunctil immune system of these patients combined with taking immunosuppressants can lead to a dampened immunity in response to the influenza vaccine. Infection with the influenza virus is a concern for multiple sclerosis patients. Previous research on multiple sclerosis patients who have received the influenza vaccine focuses on safety and relapse rates.\"\"Across the various strains incorporated into the influenza vaccine lyzed in this paper, there was no statistical difference in immune response mounted against the influenza vaccine between healthy controls and multiple sclerosis patients.\"\n\"\"\"Influenza vacction during prency for prevention of influenza confirmed illness in the infants: A systematic review and meta-lysis\"\"\"\"Infants younger than 6 months of age are at particular risk for serious illness from influenza infection. Currently available influenza vaccines are, however, not licensed for use in infants <6 months old. Influenza vacction during prency elicits robust antibody responses in the women that will protect the infants against influenza infection during the first few months of life. We aimed to determine the impact of influenza vacction during prency to prevent laboratory-confirmed influenza infection and influenza-associated hospitalisations in infants <6 months old.\n\nAn electronic search identified all studies assessing the proposed outcomes in infants after administration of influenza vaccine during prency. Two meta-lyses were performed accordingly to studies restricting the evaluation to influenza-associated hospitalisations or not.\nFour randomized control trials and 3 observatil studies reported on the prevention of laboratory-confirmed influenza infection in infants <6 months old. Matel influenza vacction was associated with a 48% [95% confidence interval (CI): 33 to 59] reduced risk of infants having laboratory-confirmed influenza infection. Four observatil studies reported on the prevention of hospitalizations associated with laboratory-confirmed influenza infection and the pool estimate was 72% (95%CI: 39% to 87%).\n\nReceipt of influenza vaccine during prency was associated with decreased risk of laboratory-confirmed influenza infection in the infants.\"\"\"\n\"Recommendations for Influenza Vacction in Burns Patients Based on a Systematic Review of the Evidence\"\"Currently in the United Kingdom, the annualtil Flu Immunisation programme outlines guidance for groups who are deemed high risk and, therefore, eligible for the influenza vaccine. At present, no guidance exists for the administration of the influenza vaccine in burn-injured patients, despite knowledge of immunosuppression. The aim of this literature review is to examine the evidence for associations between burn injury and influenza and, where available, evaluate efficacy of influenza vaccines in this cohort. In addition, literature was searched for the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine in patients 65 years and above and in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), two domains common to patients with severe burns. Three papers were found to suggest increased susceptibility to influenza following burn injury; however, no papers studying the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine in this group were found.\"\"Following the evaluation of the evidence, this review advocates for the consideration of hospitalized burn patients for the influenza vaccine.\"\n\"Decline in Seasl Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness With Vacction Program Maturation: A Systematic Review and Meta-lysis\"\"Evidence suggests that repeated influenza vacction may reduce vaccine effectiveness (VE). Using influenza vacction program maturation (PM; number of years since program inception) as a proxy for population-level repeated vacction, we assessed the impact on pooled adjusted end-season VE estimates from outpatient test-negative design studies.\"\"We obtained influenza vacction program inception year for each country and calculated PM as the difference between the year of deployment and year of program inception. We categorized PM into halves (cut at the median), tertiles, and quartiles and calculated pooled VE using an inverse-variance random-effects model. The primary outcome was pooled VE against all influenza.\"\n\"Variations in Seasl Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness due to Study Characteristics: A Systematic Review and Meta-lysis of Test-Negative Design Studies\"\"Study characteristics influence vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimation. We examined the influence of some of these on seasl influenza VE estimates from test-negative design (TND) studies.\"\"We systematically searched bibliographic databases and websites for full-text publications of TND studies on VE against laboratory-confirmed seasl influenza in outpatients after the 2009 pandemic influenza. We followed the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions guidelines. We examined influence of source of vacction information, respiratory specimen swab time, and covariate adjustment on VE. We calculated pooled adjusted VE against H1N1 and H3N2 influenza subtypes, influenza B, and all influenza using an inverse-variance random-effects model.\"\"We included 70 full-text articles. Pooled VE against H1N1 and H3N2 influenza subtypes, influenza B, and all influenza was higher for studies that used self-reported vacction than for those that used medical records.\"\n\"Characteristics and methodological standards across systematic reviews with Meta-lysis of efficacy and/or effectiveness of influenza vaccines: an overview of reviews\"\"While systematic reviews (SR) generally suggest that vacction is an effective way to prevent influenza infection, it is not clear if these conclusions are based on high quality SR methods. As such, we systematically identified, critically appraised, and summarised the characteristics and adherence to methodological standards in SRs with meta-lysis of efficacy/effectiveness of influenza vaccines.\"\"SRs with meta-lysis of efficacy/effectiveness of influenza vaccines are mostly of critically low quality and even the more recent reviews did not follow current best SR practices. These findings are significant in view of the controversies that surround influenza vaccines, and the use of SRs in informed decision-making. However, the findings do not justify curtailment or cessation of influenza vaccine use as vaccines continue to offer substantial net public health benefit.\"\n\"Efficacy and effectiveness of influenza vaccines: a systematic review and meta-lysis\"\"No published meta-lyses have assessed efficacy and effectiveness of licensed influenza vaccines in the USA with sensitive and highly specific diagnostic tests to confirm influenza.\"\"We searched Medline for randomised controlled trials assessing a relative reduction in influenza risk of all circulating influenza viruses during individual seasons after vacction (efficacy) and observatil studies meeting inclusion criteria (effectiveness).
